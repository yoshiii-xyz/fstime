# Local operating contract

This repository is a focused Rust project. The product brief and CI workflow
are authoritative. Read `docs/design.md` for the measurement model,
`docs/limits.md` for boundaries, and `docs/release.md` for release evidence.

## Commands

- Build: `cargo build --locked`
- Test: `cargo test --all-targets --locked`
- Format check: `cargo fmt --all -- --check`
- Lint: `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features --locked -- -D warnings`
- Documentation: `RUSTDOCFLAGS=-Dwarnings cargo doc --no-deps --locked`
- Package check: `cargo package --locked`
- CLI smoke test: use the commands in `docs/release.md`

## Scope

Keep changes limited to explainable, read-only local tree profiling. Do not
add frontend code, hosted services, kernel tracing, cache control, telemetry,
or unrelated compatibility promises.

## Operating loop

1. Plan the change and define a measurable success condition.
2. Make only scoped edits.
3. Read back every changed file.
4. Run relevant validation commands and record exact results.
5. Review the diff before committing or pushing.

## Safety and release

The profiler reads metadata and symlink targets but does not modify or upload
tree contents. Never put credentials or private paths in fixtures, logs, or
tracked files. Use `docs/release.md`; release requires clean local and hosted
gates, independent artifact verification, and a truthful limits record.
